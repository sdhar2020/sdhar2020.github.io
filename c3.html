							<h1>Customer Churn Prediction</h1>
							
							<h2> Customer Churn</h2>
							<p>
							As of September 2021, a rough estimate for CAC could range from $50 to $300 or more per customer (personal communications, Chat GPT August 2023). A general guideline for a good attrition rate for subscription-based online businesses was typically around 5% per month. However, it's essential to note that what constitutes a "good" attrition rate can differ significantly between industries, business model, engagement activities, competitive actions, pricing, value propositiona and service quality. Predicting and reducing customer churn or attrition is a interesting challenge.
							
							Considerations around causality related Issues in predicting customer churn is key. Some of them are as follows:
							</p>
							 <ul>
								<li>Correlation vs. Causation: Distinguishing between correlated factors and actual causes of churn.</li>
								<li>Confounding Variables: Identifying and accounting for variables that may distort causal relationships.</li>
								<li>Time Lag: Dealing with time delays between causes and the manifestation of churn.</li>
								<li>Reverse Causality: Recognizing situations where churn itself influences the identified causes.</li>
								<li>Hidden Causes: Discovering latent or unobservable factors contributing to churn.</li>
								<li>Feedback Loops: Handling situations where churn and its causes create feedback loops.</li>
								<li>Interventions: Understanding how interventions to reduce churn may impact causal relationships.</li>
								<li>Data Quality: Ensuring that data used to establish causal links is accurate and comprehensive.</li>
    </ul>
							<p> At a aggregate level churn/ attrition % is a end of period fact. Let us the assume the period to be a calender month. In the diagram below a customer who joined in Month 1 may or may not have purchases in all the following months until Month N, depending on their respect segment and behavior. Therefore based on past behavior we want to predict the probability of churn at the end of particular month, let's say Month N</p>

							<h2> Introducing the problem</h2>
							
							<p> The problem at hand is from the Fintech industry and that of a payments app that is used for paying in a ring fenced group of vending equipments. While finger printing the consumers is easy it is often hard to understand what leads to early adopter disengagement. Thanks to the subject nature of the problem there is a plethora of streaming data that can be captured in big data such as (but not limited to) app related issues, waller charging related issues, balance in wallet, first transaction time frame, open marketing offers etc.
							</p>
							
							<p> Overall, this problem looking at history of consumer experiences and then behavior and building prediction to predict in the future. Therefore, if low wallet balance in the past has lead to zero transaction in more recent times, the model generalizes that current low balances increasesw the probability in the future.
							</p>
							<p> The goal is to build a machine learning classification model that can predict probability of churn in current customers based on behavior of attrition in the past. Meaning Probability of 'No future interaction' </p>
							
							<h3> Exploratory Analysis </h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/3.Hist.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<ol start="1">
							<li>The histogram shows the consumption metric renderd by a categorical variable var2 with values A,B and C. It's data dictionary didn't sate what this is and it looks like values B,C are sparse meaning without some kind of sampling approach it is unlikely we shall see much stand alone impact in the prediction algorithm </li>
							<li>This bar graph shows the distribution of consumption across each day of the week, rendered by non working days. 5, 6 being Saturday and Sunday. It appears holidays in weekdays leads to higher consumption. A mental note to create a feature for holidays.</li>
							<li>The heatmap shows weekends late in the night shows increased consumption and week days after midday shows lower load. This appears counter intuitive but each use case has it's own nicetities that we need to build on. 4 years of history provides us history to geenralize on</li>
							</ol>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/4.Scater.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<ol start="4">
							<li> This scatter plot rendered by season shows that the variable var1 has little or no relationship/ causality with consumption</li>
							<li> This scatter plot looks samiliar to the first one. Giving reasons to think var1 and temperature are collinear. 
							</li>
							<li> The windspeed has a inverse relationship with consumption. This is a non linear relationship and gives us opprotunities to model differently
							</ol>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/5.Regplot.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<ol start="7">
							<li> pressure and consumption shows little relationship wth each other</li>
							<li> Temperature shows linear decreasing relationship wth each other. Ditto for var1
							</li>
							</ol>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/6.timeagg.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> The monthly, quarterly means don't show any significant trend however towards the end the consumption pattern shows more variations around the long term mean. The standard deviation although range bound shows variation as a result some heteroscadasticity
							</p>
							<h2> Model Development </h2>
							<p>
							Instead of pruning the variables at the get go, time segment wise regularized Ridge Regression models were developed in as a training harness as sci-kit learn <code> make_pipeline() </code>. As new time segments may get added the deployed model shall develop a new model and score the most recent time segment based on history.
							</p>
							<h3> Feature Engineering </h3>
							<p> A total of ~85 features have been used in this exercise. The important classes are as follows:
							</p>
							
							<ol start="1">
							<li> Base multivariate features: <code> 'temperature', 'var1', 'pressure', 'windspeed' </code> </li>
							<li> Time related features such as: <code> 'Year', 'Month', 'Week', 'WeekDay', 'Hour' </code>  </li>
							<li> Trigonometric features such as to capcture cyclicity: <code> 'hour_sin', 'hour_cos', 'WeekDay_sin', 'WeekDay_cos', 'Month_sin' </code>  as in the upper graph below</li>
							<li> Spline features: Example <code> 'hr_spline_0', 'hr_spline_1', 'hr_spline_2', 'hr_spline_3' </code>  etc as shown in the lower graph below</li>
							<li> New binary features such as <code> 'Holiday', 'Weekend' </code> </li>
							<li> One hot encoded variables <code> 'var2_B', 'var2_C' </code> </li>
							<li> 50 oddd interaction variables between Hourly spline variables and categorical and binary variables to capture spikes and throughs as the case may be due to interactions </li>
							
							</ol>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/7.Periodicfeatures.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> </p>
							<h3> Training and Prediction </h3>
							<p> There were two sets of model developed one looking at long term data and the other looking at short term performance. Both models use <code> RidgeCV </code> to optimize the <code> Mean Absolute Error </code> in a K= 5 cross validating frame work for each of the 48 time segments.
							</p>
							<h4> Long Term Window </h4>
							<p> The long term window model looks back a maximum of one year of hourly data and has the following general formulation:
							</p>
							<pre>
	alphas = np.logspace(-10, 6, 25)
	ts_cv = TimeSeriesSplit(
		n_splits=5,
		gap=48,
		max_train_size= max(8760/4,int(.9*len(X_train))),
		test_size= int(.1*len(X_train))
		)
	ridgecv = RidgeCV(alphas = alphas, scoring = 'neg_mean_absolute_error', normalize = True, cv= ts_cv).fit(X_train, y_train)
							</pre>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/8.RegCoeff1yr.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> The above diagram is a heatmap of the coefficents of the features in the ridge regression. Until a year worth of training data is available the values flip flop and appears unstable after that the values appear consistent. The Top 10 features with highest significance are- <pre> ['var1', 'windspeed', 'Mnth_spline_2', 'Mnth_spline_5', 'Month_cos', 
							'temperature', 'Mnth_spline, 'var2_B hr_spline_10', 
							'Month_sin',  'var2_B hr_spline_2'] </pre>
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/9.MAEMAPE by TrainSegment i1 yr.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> The MAE value improves after the 13th time segment presumably because of the longer term history helps in stabilizing thre score. The MAE isn't bad after the 12th time segment and stabilizes about ~.045. This isn't bad but works well when the long term signal is isolated from the data using thus model
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/10.Max1yrPreds.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> The above is the long term prediction of the test regimes across 47 models developed for each time segment in test. The predictions are all based on the best parameter optimization using MAE as a metric
							<h4> Short Term Window </h4>
							<p> The short term model is based on maximum look back of 3 weeks. This model will probably be less resilliant to short term noises unlike the Long term model. The cross validation time split is as follows:
							<pre>
	ts_cv = TimeSeriesSplit(
		n_splits=5,
		gap=48,
		max_train_size= 1*int(.9*552),
		test_size= int(.1*552)
    )
							</pre
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/11.RidgeCoeffs21days window.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> The feature weights appear very unstable and keeps changing their weights and as a result importance </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/12.Error21days.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> Overall the Explained Variance is better in some cases. but the MAE is lower than the long term model. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/c2/13.RidgePred21days.svg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> The short term model vissually appears to have mapped to the ups and downs better in some places than the long term model even though the overall error is higher. </p>
							<h2> opportunistic emsemble </h2>
							<p> So what is the final solution?
							
							Run the models at each tiem segment and compare the MAE and choose the model that shows better MAE as this is the metric that has been used for optimization
							
							The error profile is given in the diagram below. Indeed there can be more investgation done to improve the error rate on this.

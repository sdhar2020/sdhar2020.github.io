For the C-MAAPS data I want to build a stacked LSTM model that looks at sequence of 30,50,100 cycles where available, switches off where not available. The leading edges of the sequences should line up. The sequences Parrallel paths the pipelines and then merges the prediction in the most scientific way possible. This should be a function that takes in X_train,y_train, X_test, y_test, outputs X_test_30,X_test_50, X_test_100,y_test,y_test_pred, mae, model, training history

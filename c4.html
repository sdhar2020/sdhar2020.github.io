							<h1>Setting Up A/B Test</h1>
							
							<h2> A/B Test</h2>
							<p>
							A/B testing, is a controlled experiment in which two or more variants (A and B) of a webpage, app, or marketing element are compared to determine which one performs better in terms of a specific goal or metric, such as click-through rates, conversion rates, or user engagement. It helps businesses make data-driven decisions by assessing the impact of changes or variations on user behavior and outcomes.
							</p>
							<h2> Operational Controls for A/B Test Requiring Physical Fulfillment</h2>
							  <p>Effectively conducting A/B tests on geo-targeted campaigns that involve physical fulfillment, such as product deliveries, requires careful planning and operational controls to ensure accurate and meaningful results. Here are key operational controls to consider:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Segmentation:</strong> Ensure that you have clean and well-segmented data based on geographic regions and device types.</li>

        <li><strong>Random Sampling:</strong> Implement random sampling to select participants for each variant within the defined geographic regions and device types.</li>

        <li><strong>Geo-Targeting Accuracy:</strong> Verify the accuracy of your geo-targeting to ensure that users are correctly assigned to their respective regions.</li>

        <li><strong>Device Detection:</strong> Implement reliable device detection to accurately categorize users based on the type of device they are using.</li>

        <li><strong>Consistency in Testing Environment:</strong> Ensure that the testing environment is consistent across different geographic regions and device types.</li>

        <li><strong>Time Zone Considerations:</strong> Be aware of time zone differences when analyzing the results of geo-targeted campaigns.</li>

        <li><strong>Traffic Volume Monitoring:</strong> Monitor the traffic volume in each geo-targeted group to ensure a sufficient sample size for statistical significance.</li>

        <li><strong>Statistical Significance Threshold:</strong> Set a predefined threshold for statistical significance before starting the A/B test.</li>

        <li><strong>Control Group:</strong> Include a control group that receives no campaign or the existing campaign to compare against the variants.</li>

        <li><strong>Data Privacy Compliance:</strong> Ensure that your testing complies with data privacy regulations.</li>

        <li><strong>Monitoring and Alerting:</strong> Implement real-time monitoring and alerting systems to detect anomalies or issues during the A/B test.</li>

        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Maintain detailed documentation of the A/B test setup, including the targeted regions, device types, sample sizes, statistical methods, and timeline.</li>

        <li><strong>Post-Test Analysis:</strong> Conduct a thorough post-test analysis, including statistical analysis and interpretation of results.</li>

        <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> Establish a feedback loop to communicate results and insights with relevant teams and optimize future campaigns.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>By implementing these operational controls, you can ensure that your A/B tests on geo-targeted campaigns with physical fulfillment are conducted accurately and ethically, leading to meaningful results and data-driven decisions.</p>

							<h2> Introducing the problem</h2>
							
							<p> The problem at hand is from the Fintech industry and that of a payments app that is used for paying in a hyperlocal market. While finger printing the consumers is easy it is often hard to understand what leads to early adopter disengagement. Thanks to the subject nature of the problem there is a plethora of streaming data that can be captured in big data system such as (but not limited to) app related issues, wallet charging related issues, balance in wallet, first transaction time frame, open marketing offers etc.
							</p>
							
							<p> Overall, this problem looking at history of consumer experiences and then behavior and building prediction to predict in the future. Therefore, if low wallet balance in the past has lead to zero transaction in more recent times, the model generalizes that current low balances increasesw the probability in the future. Since the market is hyperlocal consumer profiles such as age, gender, purchase profiles are not great predictor of variability
							</p>
							<p> The goal is to build a machine learning classification model that can predict probability of churn in current customers based on behavior of attrition in the past. Meaning Probability of 'No future interaction' </p>
							
							<h2> Exploratory Analysis </h2>
								<object data="images/c3/hist.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="900" height="600">
								</object>
							<p> Univariate visualization can show some interest insights. Such as, low balance (<= $5) shows higher proportion of churn, similarly consumers with > 30 of Length of Relationship tend to churn less </p>
								<object data="images/c3/bivar.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="900" height="600">
								</object>
							<p> The bivariate jointplot shoes a ellipsoidal area with large concentration of churns. This is perhaps due to interaction of two bimodal distribution </p>
						
							<h2> Predicting Churn </h2>
							<p>
							Three machine learning models- logistic regression, random forest, xhboost for  binary classification are developed with hyperparameters fitting using and f1 score is used as quality metric. The following are the ROC curves

							<p> The recall rate is key as this determines ability to target with retention engagement. The model to be used is determined by factors such as budget. In this case the Random Forest model ought to be used </p>
							<object data="images/c3/cfm.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="900" height="600"></object>
							<h2> Recall Rate </h2>
							<p> The recall rate clearly needs to be maximized in the current context. The following steps can be used as next steps:
							</p>
							<ul>
        <li><strong>Data Augmentation:</strong> Increase the representation of the minority class by generating synthetic data points or using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Carefully select and engineer features that highlight important patterns and characteristics of both classes, aiding the model's ability to distinguish between them.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithm Selection:</strong> Choose algorithms that are well-suited for imbalanced datasets, such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines, as they can capture complex relationships better.</li>
        <li><strong>Threshold Adjustment:</strong> Modify the classification threshold to prioritize recall over precision, particularly when false negatives are more costly than false positives.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensemble Methods:</strong> Combine multiple models, such as bagging or boosting, to improve overall performance and recall by leveraging the strengths of different algorithms or subsets of the data.</li>
    </ul>
